# Amazon-Sales

This project is my first independent project. The aim of this project was to analyze the sales performance of Amazon and get insight of the past performance. Some of the main questions for developing this project are related to the prices of products, discount, and rating.

Dataset of this project was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset. It contains the data of 1K+ Amazon Product's Ratings and Reviews and the details listed on the official website of Amazon.

The tools for data analysis used in this project are the packages **Numpy** and **Pandas**, and to visualize and explore the data: **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

I used the dataset available and began the process of dataset walktrough, data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and followed by data visualization.
